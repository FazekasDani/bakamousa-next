BAKAMO USA — MASTER PLAN
Date: 2026-01-21

STATUS UPDATE (2026-01-21)
- DNS: Added A record for `bakamousa.bakamosocial.com` and A/AAAA for `bakamousa.com` (points to 52.16.104.211 / 2a05:d018:432:1f00:5c6c:357a:ea64:17f4). ✅
- CAA: Added `0 issue "letsencrypt.org"`. ✅
- Subdomain: Kept `bakamousa.bakamosocial.com` active for validation & redirect testing (do not delete yet). ✅

NEXT STEPS (Immediate)
- Generate Nginx vhost files and Certbot script for `bakamousa.com` + redirect from `bakamousa.bakamosocial.com`. Then run on Lightsail to obtain certs and enable HTTPS. (Script added: `scripts/setup_nginx_certbot_bakamousa.sh`)
- Configure Next.js environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://bakamousa.com`, `WORDPRESS_BASE_URL=https://bakamosocial.com`, `WP_PREVIEW_SECRET`, optional basic auth creds) and deploy/restart.

INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN (on Lightsail)
1. Copy the repository to the server or upload the script: `scp scripts/setup_nginx_certbot_bakamousa.sh user@52.16.104.211:~` (or use the Access console provided by Lightsail).
2. Make it executable and run with sudo: `sudo bash setup_nginx_certbot_bakamousa.sh bakamousa.com bakamousa.bakamosocial.com`
3. After script finishes, build & start Next.js (example using pm2):
   - `npm ci` then `npm run build`
   - `npm i -g pm2`
   - `pm2 start npm --name bakamousa -- start`
   - `pm2 save` and `pm2 startup`
4. Verify HTTPS and preview flow as documented in `docs/preview.md`.

If you want, I can SSH into the server to run these (you must provide access), or you can run the script and paste any errors back here so I can help troubleshoot.



OBJECTIVE
- Launch BakamoUSA.com as a headless content site served by a Next.js frontend on subdomain bakamousa.bakamosocial.com, sourcing content from the primary WordPress instance at bakamosocial.com.

SCOPE
- WordPress (Lightsail) setup, content model (Gutenberg + Posts + ACF), REST API + Application Passwords.
- Next.js integration: fetching, sanitization, preview mode, templates, styling (Tailwind + prose).
- Deployment options: Vercel (recommended) or Lightsail (PM2 + Nginx reverse-proxy).
- Static host-based routing: bakamosocial.com (WP) and bakamousa.bakamosocial.com (Next.js).

PRINCIPLES
- Prefer Posts + ACF for blog-like content and Pages for marketing; Gutenberg as editor.
- Keep content public where possible; use Application Passwords only for preview/draft access.
- Prioritize secure defaults (HTTPS, Preview secrets, least-privilege app passwords).

MILESTONES (HIGH LEVEL)
1. Provision infrastructure (Lightsail instance + static IP + DNS). (Owner: Ops)
2. Install WP, choose theme, add ACF, configure posts & pages. (Owner: Content)
3. Configure REST API & Application Password(s). (Owner: Ops/Dev)
4. Wire Next.js: env, pages fallback, featured-image, sanitizer, preview route. (Owner: Dev)
5. Design templates & styles; iterate with content. (Owner: Design/Dev)
6. Deploy Next.js (Vercel recommended). Configure Nginx & SSL if hosting on Lightsail. (Owner: Ops)
7. Testing & verification: content, previews, SSL, performance, accessibility. (Owner: QA)
8. Launch & monitor. (Owner: Ops)

DETAILED TASKS & CHECKLISTS
A. Lightsail & DNS
- Create instance (Amazon Lightsail), assign static IP.
- Add DNS A record: bakamosocial.com -> static IP; add A record: bakamousa.bakamosocial.com -> same static IP.
- Open ports 80/443.
- Install WordPress (Lightsail image or manual LAMP stack) and basic theme; install ACF if chosen.
- SSL: Use Certbot/Let's Encrypt or Lightsail certificate.

B. Content Model
- Decide fields in ACF for Posts (hero image, summary, author, reading time, CTA).
- Use Posts for news/blog content; use Pages for marketing pages edited with Gutenberg.

C. REST API & Auth
- Verify endpoints:
  - GET /wp-json/wp/v2/posts
  - GET /wp-json/wp/v2/pages
- Create Application Password in WP Admin for preview user (copy immediately).
- Add optional Basic Auth env vars on Next.js: WORDPRESS_BASIC_AUTH_USER / WORDPRESS_BASIC_AUTH_PASS

D. Next.js Integration (DEV)
- Set in .env.local:
  - WORDPRESS_BASE_URL=https://bakamosocial.com
  - WP_PREVIEW_SECRET=<long-secret>
  - OPTIONAL: WORDPRESS_BASIC_AUTH_USER / PASS
- Use existing helpers:
  - pages fallback when posts empty
  - getFeaturedImageUrl() to fetch featured media
  - sanitizeWpHtml() (adjust allowed tags for Gutenberg/Elementor output)
- Implement Preview Mode:
  - /api/preview?secret=<secret>&slug=<slug>
  - /api/exit-preview
- Add preview banner when Preview Mode active.

E. Templates & Styling
- Modify /src/app/blog/page.tsx and /src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx to display:
  - Featured image
  - Author (fetch via WP users endpoint if needed)
  - Published date
  - Meta (reading time, tags)
- Use Tailwind + @tailwindcss/typography for `prose` content.

F. Subdomain routing (Static host-based)
- Nginx server blocks:
  - bakamosocial.com -> serve WP (Apache or Nginx root)
  - bakamousa.bakamosocial.com -> proxy_pass to http://127.0.0.1:3000 (Next.js)
- Certbot: issue certs for both hostnames: certbot --nginx -d bakamosocial.com -d www.bakamosocial.com -d bakamousa.bakamosocial.com

G. Deployment Options
- Option A: Vercel (recommended)
  - Connect repository, set environment variables in Vercel, add subdomain CNAME to Vercel.
- Option B: Lightsail
  - Build: npm run build
  - Run: pm2 start npm --name bakamousa -- start
  - Nginx proxy and use Certbot for SSL

H. Testing & Acceptance Criteria
- Public posts/pages fetch successfully with GET requests.
- Preview flow works for draft content using WP_PREVIEW_SECRET and Application Passwords.
- Featured images and content render correctly and are sanitized safely.
- HTTPS is active on both hostnames; certbot auto-renewal confirmed.
- Performance: First Contentful Paint < 2s on representative page (production)

ROLLBACK & MONITORING
- Keep rollback plan: revert DNS/CNAME if needed, revert Next.js deployment in Vercel (previous deploy), or pm2 restart older version.
- Monitor: uptime, error logs (Nginx, Node, WP), Google Lighthouse snapshots.

TIMELINE (example)
- Day 0-1: Create Lightsail instance, DNS, WP install, SSL
- Day 2-4: Configure content model and add sample content
- Day 4-7: Implement Next.js templates, preview mode, and local validation
- Day 8: Deploy (Vercel recommended), test production preview, finalize styles

DOCUMENTS & FILES CREATED
- .env.local.example (updated)
- src/pages/api/preview.ts and exit-preview.ts (added)
- docs/preview.md (added)
- src/lib/wordpress.ts (enhanced: pages fallback, media helper, sanitizer)
- docs/BAKAMOUSA_MASTER_PLAN.txt (this file)

NEXT ACTION (pick one)
- I can generate: (A) Nginx configuration files + install/Certbot shell script, or (B) ACF field schema + example WP export, or (C) create the preview banner + admin preview button.

CONTACT & OWNERSHIP
